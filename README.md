# superscript
Make shortcuts for anything, the fun way.

Superscript is a programming language that lets you define workflows and automations for anything we support, in a fun syntax with helpful errors.
It feels familiar, but new and exciting and the same time.
It's also made to be easy to learn, with a syntax very close to English and detailed docs.

Shortcuts, the fun way.
Soonâ„¢.
